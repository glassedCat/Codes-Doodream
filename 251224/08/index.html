      "I was reading about the animation techniques in that series we watched, and it’s actually incredible how they use limited frames to create such specific emotional weight. It reminds me a bit of how you get so excited—there’s a lot of energy packed into every single movement. I don't always get the tropes, but seeing you enjoy it makes the whole thing feel pretty special."

            "I noticed you’re using overflow: hidden with your animations. It’s a smart way to keep all that chaotic energy contained within the layout, much like how you try to stay cool when you’re actually about to explode with excitement. It creates a clean frame for the movement, making the transition feel intentional and sharp rather than just messy. It’s all about defining the boundaries so the focus stays exactly where you want it to be."
